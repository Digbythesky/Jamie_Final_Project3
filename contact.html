<h1>Why Should One Care About Eclipses?</h1>
<p>Eclipses as previously stated are interesting phenomenons that occur quite rarely in our orbit. Not many get to experience these rare occurances in their lifetimes, and if you miss one the chances of seeing another one is slim to none. If you're interested in space, or just moon/sun phases in general-- it's worth giving it a try and stopping for a moment to appreciate the remarkable sight if you're given the chance.</p>
